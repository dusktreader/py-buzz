**_That's not flying, it's falling with style_: Exceptions with extras**

![asciicast](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz/blob/main/docs/source/images/py-buzz.gif)

py-buzz is fully equipped with a suite of exception tools that will save you
from writing the same code over and over again in your python projects. These
include:

* checking conditions and raising errors on failure (`require_conditon`)
* checking that values are defined and raising errors if not (`enforce_defined`)
* catching exceptions wrapping them in clearer exception types with better error
  messages (`handle_errors`)
* checking many conditions and reporting which ones failed
  (`check_expressions`)

py-buz also provides an exception class, Buzz, that can be used  as a base class
for custom exceptions within a project.

## Super-quick Start

* Only requires Python 3.8 or later
* Installed with pip (`$ pip install py-buzz`)
* Each feature demonstrated in [examples](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz/tree/main/examples)
