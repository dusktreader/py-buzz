_That's not flying, it's falling with style_

Take Exceptions to infinity...and beyond with ``py-buzz``!

## Overview

Have you ever found yourself writing the same code over and over to provide error
handling in your python projects? I certainly did. In fact, I found that I often
needed to re-implement the same patterns in almost every project. These patterns
included:

* checking conditions and raising errors on failure
* checking that values are defined and raising errors if they are not
* catching exceptions and wrapping them in clearer exception types with better error
  messages
* checking many conditions and reporting which ones failed

This led me to create an exception toolkit called `py-buzz` that provides powerful
helper tools for each of the cases listed above. The `py-buzz` package intends to
make your error handling easy, expressive, and robust.

Because `py-buzz` requires only Python itself, it's a very light-weight package
that you can use in any project with very little overhead.

`py-buzz` provides functionality or two different main use-cases. Either use-case
allows you to focus on clear and concise error handling in your project without
a lot of repetitive code:

### Helper Functions

This set of functions can be used with any exception types. So, if you already
have a set of custom exceptions or simply wish to use existing exceptions, you can
import the py-buzz functions like `require_condition`, `handle_errors`, `enforce_defined`,
and use them in your code immediately.

### `Buzz` base class

This class is meant to be used as a base class for custom exceptions that you can use
in your project. `Buzz` includes all of the helper functions as class methods that will
use your custom exception type.



## Quickstart

### Requirements

* Python 3.9 or greater


### Installation

This will install the latest release of py-buzz from pypi via pip:

```bash
pip install py-buzz
```


### Usage

Just import!

```python
from buzz import require_condition

require_condition(check_something(), "The check failed!")
```

For more examples of usage, see the [Features](features.md) page.
